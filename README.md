# SimpleSVM
A simple sub-gradient SVM implementation in python and numpy

When looking for a starting point for SVM research, the standard quadratic solvers seemed slow and overly complicated. This implementation uses dual coordinate descent based on the paper "A Dual Coordinate Descent Algorithm for SVMs Combined with Rational Kernels" by Allauzen et al.
